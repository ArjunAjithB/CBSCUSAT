]# Python Classwork


Welcome to the **CBS** collaborative Python repository!
This is a simple project where  you will practice using Git, GitHub, branching, commits, and pull requests, while writing some basic Python.

## What you have to do?

Steps
1. Open the file *cbspy.py* directly on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch with your name (for example: hasi-feature).
3. Edit the file to add a line that prints your name.
4. Commit your changes to your branch.

Example 

def main():
    print("Welcome to the CBS's first collective Python programming!")
    print("Hello from Hasi at CBS!")


Happy coding & collaborating with GitHub!
